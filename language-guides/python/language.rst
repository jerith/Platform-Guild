    gotcha
        a valid construct in a system, programm or programming language that:

            1)
                .. epigraph::
                    "works as documented but is counter-intuitive and almost
                    invites mistakes because it is both easy to invoke and
                    unexpected or unreasonable in its outcome"

                    -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotcha_(programming)

            2) doesn't work exactly like :samp:`{XYZ other programming
            language} I know`
