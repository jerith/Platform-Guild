General Software Guidelines
===========================

The focus of this document is to collect some general recommendations
for writing Good Softwareâ„¢.

Since such a document is hopeless to complete, hard to pin down,
difficult to vet, and impossible to agree upon, it is to be expected
that *all* of the recommendations below are controversial, incomplete,
or contradictory. To combat these difficulties we first list a few noble
goals whose achievement guides our selection of recommendations.

Software should be:

    * Easier to *read* than to *write* -- most software will be written once,
      but read many times
    * Easy to test -- we take as an axiom that software that is difficult to
      test will violate at least one other non-testing faux pas listed here
    * Flexible, generic, but not "abstract nonsense"

Software should also follow the spirit of our `Engineering Manifesto
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GUF84m4XV3aQtrE1PVHsSzeEgSQ3zaxJOS5xHj9RLn0/edit#slide=id.gc7987cad8_0_12>`_
which documents our values as a department.
