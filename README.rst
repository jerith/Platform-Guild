The `Magnetic <http://www.magnetic.com>`_ platform guild is an Engineering
interest group for developers of high throughput, real-time systems.

This repository collects some of our recommendations (for each other) within
our areas of interest.


`Our manifesto`_ describes some of our high level principles and directives.

How Are Guild Principles Decided?
---------------------------------

Collectively!

Guild meetings, email chains, IRC, Slack and hallway meetings are all
appropriate forums for improving our principles and policies.

Disagree with an existing principle, guideline, or policy? Send a pull
request to change it!
