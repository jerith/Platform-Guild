How Are Guild Principles Decided?
---------------------------------

Collectively!

Guild meetings, email chains, IRC, Slack and hallway meetings are all
appropriate forums for improving our principles and policies.

Have an improvement to make to the documentation? Disagree with an
existing principle, guideline, or policy? Change it! These documents live `on
GitHub <https://github.com/Magnetic/Platform-Guild>`_.


About This Repo
---------------

The policy documents in this repository are public.

Some of the linked source code or other associated documents might not be.

Some effort has been expended to make the surrounding prose in these instances
understandable in isolation.

Please forgive inaccuracies or poor wording, as these documents are
continuously evolving. Our initial goals prefer breadth of content
over depth, so terseness, brevity, or incompleteness are especially
prevalent.

It also lacks copy-editing, so there are undoubtedly awkward sentences,
missing commas, splellieng mistakes, and oxford commas. Forgive those
too, but carry your red pen. Pull requests welcome.

When making changes to the documentation, you can run the test suite (which
checks for style, spelling and syntax, amongst other things) via `tox` (or
`detox`).
